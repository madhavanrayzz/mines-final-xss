Resumes based on last processed URL, not index.

Starts from 30 URLs earlier (fallback).

Logs URLs with alert popups in alert_xss_found.txt.

Logs screenshots (but no folder creation) in alert_screenshots_log.txt.

Logs failed tabs (timeout/load errors) in failed_tabs.txt.

Retries failed tabs automatically at the end.
